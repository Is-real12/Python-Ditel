# (custom datatpre) we use classes to create our own datatype;
# car

# specialized datatype

# None

# fundamental data types

print (type(2))
print (type(2.0))
print (type(True))
print (type("david"))

# the class that shows when you run  is to show what type of datatype it is in python;
# we have talked about iput type and print

# the operators in python are + - / * % // (this // is floor division is to divide a number and throw away the decimal point or remainder and gives the whole number)
# modulo gives the remainder of a number when divided while floor gives the whole number and throw awa the remainder
# e.g, 10/3 (normally this should give 3.33333) but if you use floor division e.g, 10//3, it will trow awa the decimal and give whole num.



# # name = 'alphred'

password = str(input("enter a password: "))
hidden_password = len(password) * '*'
print(hidden_password)



# len is leght of whatever is in ur parenthesis

# 10 // 4 is = 2.5 beacuse 4 goes in 10 twice, while so it trows the . somthing away, and..... "len is lenght"bbbbbbh


# my own done
password1 = input("enter your name")
