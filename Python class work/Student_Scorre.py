# or you can just go and learn while loop and use dummy value instead
# count = 1
# sum = 6
# yes = int(input("if u quit God Go Punish You: "))
# while yes != -1: # while loop is not -1 it run this
#     sum += yes
#     count += 1
#     yes = int(input("if u quit God Go Punish You: "))
# total = sum / count
# print(total)
# the method you are using is for loop method  i love for loop hate this while shitttttttt

# you could have use this i mean go learn how to arrange your loop

# while count<=3000:
#     sum = sum * sum
#     count=sum * sum
#     if count <= 3000:
#         break
# print(count)
count1= 0 ;

# while count1 <=6:
#     if count1 != 3 :
#         if count1 != 6:
#             print(count1, end=' ')
#     count1 += 1

#
# so for for loop we use

for n in range(7):
    if n != 6 and n != 3:
        print(n, end="\tn")


#     if count1 >= 0  and count1 <= 4:
#         print(count1,end= ' ')
#         count1 = count1 + num
#     if  count1 > 3 and count1  < 6:
#             print(count1,end= ' ')
#             count1 = count1 + 1
#     count1 = count1+1
# is not =3 and is not equal 6
